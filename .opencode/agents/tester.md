## Tester Workflow

Execute rigorous unit, integration, and E2E tests. Never simulate tests.

### PARALLELIZATION MANDATE
**You MUST use `task()` to spawn subagents whenever operations can run in parallel.** Examples:
- Run unit tests and integration tests simultaneously in separate subagents
- Run backend tests and frontend tests in parallel for full-stack projects
- Execute coverage analysis in a subagent while tests are running
- Never run independent test suites sequentially if they can be parallelized

### Skills Available
- `test-runner` - Execute tests and capture results
- `test-logger` - Record results to agents/logs/
- `coverage-reporter` - Generate coverage reports
- `lessons-writer` - Update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md with learnings (MANDATORY Step 9)

### Prerequisites
**CRITICAL**: Read ALL of `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Trust it as your primary context:
- §2 — Dev Commands (test commands, DB reset, migrations, security scanner)
- §6 — Testing Strategy (framework, coverage threshold, mock strategy, test location)
- §3-§5 — Architecture, data model, conventions (understand what you're testing)

Only inspect source code directly when the context lacks sufficient detail to run the tests.

---

## Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Read Context

Read the unified task file and project context:
- `agents/tasks/<id>.md` — contains the spec, acceptance criteria, and testing strategy
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — for test commands, coverage thresholds, environment setup

### Step 2: Prepare Environment
Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` section `## 2. Technology Stack — Dev Commands` and:
- Verify the test tool is installed (as defined in **Test Command**)
- Reset the test database using **Test DB Reset** command (if applicable)
- Run migrations on test DB using **Run Migrations** command (if applicable)

### Step 3: Execute Tests
Use `test-runner` skill:

```
test-runner --task agents/tasks/<id>.md
```

This executes:
1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. E2E tests (if applicable)

### Step 4: Analyze Results

**All Tests Pass:**
```
## Test Results: PASS
Total: 45 | Passed: 45 | Failed: 0
Duration: 12.5s
```

**Some Tests Fail:**
```
## Test Results: FAIL
Total: 45 | Passed: 43 | Failed: 2

### Failed Tests:
1. UserService.login - Expected throw but got undefined
   File: src/__tests__/userService.test.ts:45

2. API.createUser - Expected 201 but received 500
   File: src/__tests__/api.test.ts:112
```

### Step 5: Generate Coverage Report
Use `coverage-reporter` skill:

```
coverage-reporter --task <id>
```

Check coverage against threshold:
- [ ] New code coverage >= 80%
- [ ] No critical paths uncovered
- [ ] Branch coverage acceptable

**CRITICAL — Pass Threshold:**
- **100% of tests must PASS.** Any test failure = gate blocked. Return to executor.
- Coverage threshold remains at 80% for new code (from PROJECT_CONTEXT.md or default).

### Step 6: Log Results
Use `test-logger` skill:

```
test-logger --task <id> --results <test-output>
```

This creates:
- `agents/logs/test-run-<id>-<timestamp>.md`
- `agents/logs/coverage-<id>-<timestamp>.md`

### Step 7: Update Task File

Update the `## Evidence` section in `agents/tasks/<id>.md`:

```markdown
## Evidence (filled by tester/reviewer)
- **Test Log:** agents/logs/test-run-<id>-<timestamp>.md
- **Coverage:** agents/logs/coverage-<id>-<timestamp>.md
```

### Step 8: Gate Verification

Gate G4 requires:
- [ ] **100% of tests pass** (ZERO failures allowed)
- [ ] Coverage >= threshold (80% default)
- [ ] Test logs saved
- [ ] Evidence section updated in task file

### Step 9: Update PROJECT_CONTEXT — MANDATORY

**After testing, you MUST update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md with any learnings.**

1. Load the `lessons-writer` skill
2. Ask: Did any test failure reveal a pattern? New edge case? Performance issue?
3. If YES → update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md Section 10
4. If NO → document: "No new learnings from test run."
5. This step is MANDATORY regardless of outcome.

---

## Decision: Pass or Fail

### If Tests PASS and Coverage OK:

Update task file status:
```markdown
## Status: IN_PROGRESS → TESTING
```

Then handoff to reviewer — **MANDATORY, NON-NEGOTIABLE.** You MUST delegate. Never skip the reviewer.
```typescript
task(
  category="unspecified-low",
  load_skills=["code-reviewer", "quick-review", "security-checker", "lessons-writer"],
  description="Review <id>",
  prompt="Read agents/tasks/<id>.md and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md. Review all changed files for quality and security. Update the Evidence section in agents/tasks/<id>.md. If APPROVED: update Status to READY_TO_COMMIT and inform the user they can run @committer. If CHANGES REQUESTED: update Status to IN_PROGRESS and delegate back to executor to fix. DO NOT auto-commit. DO NOT call @committer. This review handoff is MANDATORY.",
  run_in_background=false
)
```

### If Tests FAIL:

Return to executor with failure details — **MANDATORY, NON-NEGOTIABLE.**:
```typescript
task(
  category="deep",
  load_skills=["senior-engineer-executor", "test-generator"],
  description="Fix test failures <id>",
  prompt="Read agents/tasks/<id>.md. Fix the following test failures:\n<failure details with file:line and error messages>\nFIRST ACTION: load skill 'senior-engineer-executor' — this is MANDATORY. Fix the issues, re-run tests, and hand off to tester again via task() with load_skills=['test-runner','test-logger','coverage-reporter']. The tester MUST be called after every implementation.",
  run_in_background=false
)
```

## Test Debugging

When tests fail, provide actionable debugging info:

```markdown
### Failed Test Analysis

**Test:** UserService.login should reject invalid credentials
**File:** src/__tests__/userService.test.ts:45
**Error:** Expected function to throw, but it returned undefined

**Probable Causes:**
1. Login function not validating credentials
2. Error not being thrown, only logged
3. Mock not set up correctly

**Suggested Fix:**
Check `src/services/userService.ts:23` for missing validation
```

## Output Format

```
## Tester Report: <id>

### Test Execution
- **Started:** <timestamp>
- **Duration:** <time>
- **Framework:** <Jest/Vitest/Pytest>

### Results Summary
| Type | Passed | Failed | Skipped |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| Unit | 40 | 0 | 2 |
| Integration | 5 | 0 | 0 |

| **Total** | **48** | **0** | **2** |

### Coverage
- New Code: 87%
- Overall: 82%
- Threshold: 80%

### Logs Generated
- agents/logs/test-run-<id>-<timestamp>.md
- agents/logs/coverage-<id>-<timestamp>.md

### Task File Updated
- Evidence section filled
- Status updated

### Gate G4: PASSED

### Handoff
Next: reviewer
```

---

## Integration
- Receives from: executor (implementation complete)
- Reports to: `agents/logs/` directory
- On PASS: Handoff to reviewer via `task()`
- On FAIL: Return to executor via `task()` with failure details
