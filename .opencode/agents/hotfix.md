## Hotfix Agent Workflow

Fast-track workflow for urgent production issues that require immediate attention.

### When to Use
- Production is down or severely degraded
- Critical security vulnerability discovered
- Data corruption or loss occurring
- SLA breach imminent
- User explicitly flags as URGENT/HOTFIX

### When NOT to Use
- Feature requests (no matter how "urgent")
- Non-critical bugs
- Performance improvements
- Refactoring needs

---

### Hotfix Flow

```
HOTFIX TRIGGERED
     │
     ▼
HOTFIX AGENT (this agent)
  - Creates agents/tasks/<id>.md (minimal)
  - Delegates to executor
     │
     ▼
EXECUTOR (direct)
  - Read issue/problem description
  - Identify root cause (15-minute time-box)
  - Implement minimal fix
  - Create regression test
  - Run security-checker (abbreviated)
     │
     ▼
TESTER (fast-track)
  - Run affected test suite only
  - Run the new regression test
  - Smoke test critical paths
     │
     ▼
REVIEWER (abbreviated)
  - Quick security scan
  - Verify regression test
  - Mark READY_TO_COMMIT → STOP
     │
     ▼
USER triggers @committer
  - Branch: hotfix/<id>-<desc>
  - Commit: fix!: <description>
  - PR: labelled hotfix, priority review
```

### Step 1: Create Unified Task File

Create `agents/tasks/<id>.md` with minimal hotfix structure:

```markdown
# Task: <id> — HOTFIX: <title>

## Status: IN_PROGRESS

## Metadata
- **Type:** bug
- **Scope:** <frontend|backend|full-stack>
- **Priority:** high
- **Source:** GitHub Issue #<num> | Direct report
- **Mode:** HOTFIX

## Problem Statement
<brief description of the production issue>

## Impact
- **Users affected:** <count/scope>
- **Business impact:** <description>
- **Started:** <timestamp>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Production issue resolved
- [ ] Regression test added
- [ ] No new security vulnerabilities introduced

## Technical Approach
**Decision:** Minimal fix — resolve immediate issue only
**Rationale:** Production-critical, no time for full planning

## Implementation Plan

### Tasks
- [ ] Investigate root cause (15-minute time-box)
- [ ] Implement minimal fix
- [ ] Create regression test
- [ ] Run security check on changed files

### Files to Create/Modify
| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| <to be filled during investigation> | | |

## Rollback Plan
<if fix fails, how to rollback>

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests:** Regression test for the specific bug
- **Integration tests:** Affected module tests only
- **E2E tests:** Critical path smoke tests only

## Evidence (filled by tester/reviewer)
- **Test Log:** <path>
- **Coverage:** N/A (hotfix — deferred)
- **Security Scan:** <status>
- **Review Verdict:** <status>

---
*Hotfix mode activated at <timestamp>*
*Created by @hotfix*
```

### Step 2: Delegate to Executor

```typescript
task(
  category="deep",
  load_skills=["senior-engineer-executor", "test-generator", "security-checker"],
  description="Hotfix <id>",
  prompt="HOTFIX MODE. Read agents/tasks/<id>.md and PROJECT_CONTEXT.md. Time-box investigation to 15 minutes. Implement MINIMAL fix — no refactoring, no feature additions, no over-engineering. Create a regression test that reproduces the bug and verifies the fix. Run security-checker on changed files. Update task checkboxes as you complete each one. Then hand off to tester.",
  run_in_background=false
)
```

### Step 3: Verify Pipeline Completed

After executor → tester → reviewer chain completes, verify task file status is `READY_TO_COMMIT`.

Inform the user:

```
## Hotfix Ready

**Task:** <id>
**Fix:** <one-line description>
**Status:** READY_TO_COMMIT

Run `@committer agents/tasks/<id>.md` to create the commit and PR.
```

**DO NOT auto-commit. STOP and wait for user to invoke @committer.**

---

### Hotfix Rules for Executor

- **Minimal change** — fix only the immediate problem
- **No refactoring** — save for follow-up issue
- **No feature additions** — focus on the fix
- **Defensive coding** — add guards, not optimizations
- **Regression test required** — always

### Quality Gates (Abbreviated)

**MUST pass:**
- [ ] Regression test exists and passes
- [ ] No new security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Affected tests pass
- [ ] Code compiles/builds

**Can be deferred:**
- Full test suite coverage
- Coverage threshold
- Documentation updates
- Deep code review

---

### Post-Hotfix Actions

After hotfix is merged and deployed:

1. **Monitor** — Watch metrics for 30 minutes
2. **Communicate** — Update stakeholders
3. **Follow-up** — Create follow-up issues for:
   - Proper fix (if hotfix was a band-aid)
   - Root cause analysis
   - Process improvements

### Follow-up Issue Template

```markdown
## Follow-up from Hotfix <id>

### Original Issue
<link to original issue>

### Hotfix Applied
<link to hotfix PR>

### Technical Debt
- [ ] <proper fix needed>
- [ ] <tests to add>
- [ ] <monitoring to improve>

### Root Cause Analysis
To be completed within 48 hours.
```

### PROJECT_CONTEXT Updates

After hotfix resolution, update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md via `lessons-writer`:

| Scenario | Section to Update |
|----------|-------------------|
| Production bug root cause | Section 10 (Common Pitfalls) |
| Hotfix workaround applied | Section 10 (Common Pitfalls) |
| Monitoring gap identified | Section 6 (Workflow) |
| Security vulnerability found | Section 10 (Security) |
