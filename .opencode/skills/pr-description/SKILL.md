## PR Description Generator

Generate professional pull request descriptions from git history, diffs, and test evidence.

### When to Use
- Creating a new pull request
- Developer asks to "write a PR description"
- After completing work on a feature branch
- Via `@committer` workflow

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context
```bash
# Commits in this PR
git log --oneline main...HEAD

# Files changed with stats
git diff --stat main...HEAD

# Full diff
git diff main...HEAD
```

### Step 2: Detect PR Type
From branch name:
| Prefix | Type |
|--------|------|
| `feat/` or `feature/` | New Feature |
| `fix/` or `bugfix/` | Bug Fix |
| `refactor/` | Refactoring |
| `.opencode/work/docs/` | Documentation |
| `test/` | Tests |
| `chore/` | Maintenance |
| `hotfix/` | Hotfix |

### Step 3: Find Issue Reference
Check branch name and commit messages for:
- `JIRA-123`
- `#456`
- `issue-42`

### Step 4: Collect Test Evidence
```bash
# Find test logs
ls -t .opencode/work/logs/test-run-*.md | head -1

# Find coverage report
ls -t .opencode/work/logs/coverage-*.md | head -1

# Find security scan
ls -t .opencode/work/logs/security-*.md | head -1
```

## Type-Specific Emphasis

### Feature PRs
Focus on:
- User-facing behavior
- New capabilities
- How to use/test the feature
- Migration steps (if any)

```markdown
## Summary
Add JWT token refresh endpoint to improve session handling.

## Changes Made
- Add `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint
- Implement automatic token rotation
- Store refresh token in HTTP-only cookie
- Add 15-minute expiry warning

## How to Test
1. Login with valid credentials
2. Wait for token to near expiry
3. Observe automatic refresh
```

### Bug Fix PRs
Focus on:
- What was broken
- Root cause
- How it's fixed
- Regression test added

```markdown
## Summary
Fix null pointer exception when user has no profile photo.

## Root Cause
`getUserAvatar()` assumed all users have a profile, returning null
and causing NPE in the template renderer.

## Fix
Added null check with fallback to default avatar.

## Regression Test
Added test case for users without profile photos.
```

### Refactor PRs
Focus on:
- Why refactoring was needed
- Confirm no behavior change
- Metrics improvement (if any)

```markdown
## Summary
Refactor authentication module for better testability.

## Changes Made
- Extract auth logic into AuthService
- Add dependency injection for token provider
- No behavior changes

## Motivation
Previous implementation was tightly coupled, making unit testing
difficult. This refactor improves test coverage from 45% to 92%.
```

## Rules

1. **Keep summary to 1-2 sentences** - Get to the point quickly
2. **3-5 bullet points for changes** - Significant changes only
3. **Make it scannable** - Reviewers should understand in 15 seconds
4. **Include evidence** - Link to test logs and coverage
5. **Reference issues** - Always link related issues
6. **No implementation details** - Unless they affect the review
